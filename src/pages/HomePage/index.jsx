    <p>The reasoning behind the work here is to do with being in lockdown.
        I became very aware of missing going out and putting on perfume and also 
        shopping for perfumes or having scented candles at home.
        I was looking for images of perfume shop windows and by accident came across the photographs
        you see here. The rest, as they say is history!  </p>
